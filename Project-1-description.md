Unit 1 Project Description


For this project, you will be writing and commenting on an ethics case like the cases we have been reading in this unit. 


An ethics case is a description of a situation that is morally ambiguous.  It describes a named agent who is facing an ethical dilemma or conflict, and it is written in such a way as to bring out and elucidate this conflict. Excellent instructions exist for the writing of ethical cases, including the Makkula Center’s A Template for Technology Ethics Cases. Use these instructions to create a case that you find morally compelling.


Once you have a compelling case, you can write a moral commentary on it. Basically, the point of the commentary is to examine your case from each of the moral perspectives we have been discussing in class. In this case, what does past experience suggest about what your agent will find desirable?  Acceptable? Approvable? Which of these perspectives is more important to consider in this particular case? How do the factors specific to Good (desire), Right (acceptance), and Virtue (approval) conflict in this situation?  What kinds of actions ought the agent to take?  Follow-ups?


Write your case and commentary together.  The trick is to describe a situation in which there is genuine conflict among the three moral factors we have been discussing.  The case itself can take the form of the cases we have been reading.  The commentary section can be an essay or a letter or message–up to you. These two pieces together should total 1500-1800 words (3-4 single spaced pages). 


Any style, tone, or level of polish will be acceptable.  Don’t use an LLM, but consider text-to-speech. I’m really interested in how you are thinking about these cases.  I’m not concerned about the form your writings take.


A note on paper submission: This project must be submitted on paper (not digitally) in class on the date listed in the course schedule.  With each final draft, each student will submit relevant drafts and in-class writings in a folder that shows the development of the final draft.  Free printing for students taking WRT courses is available in the Digital Writing and Research Studio (DWARS) in 320 Roosevelt Hall. Unless otherwise approved by the instructor, digital submissions of unit projects will not be accepted.
